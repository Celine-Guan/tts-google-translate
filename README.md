I built a simple speech assistant app which speaking Mandarin Chinese using the speech regonition library and Google's text-to-speech API 

The App is called Celine. She can anwser your questions in Mandarin Chinese, for instance, what's your name? What time is it? Also, she can help you Google the information and find an address using Google Maps. 

## Here are the voice commends in Mandarin Chinese: 
- 你叫什么名字 (What's your name?)
- 现在几点了 (What time is it?)
- 我想查找 (I'd like to google...)
- 地图 (Map)
- 退出 (Quit)
